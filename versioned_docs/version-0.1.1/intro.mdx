### Install via NPM

* Install the CSS library using npm by running the following command in the directory where your project is located:
npm install `yummacss`:

```

* In your HTML file's `<head>` section, add a `<head>` tag to include the compiled CSS file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/yummacss/dist/yumma.css">
```

### Integrate via CDN

* Add a `<link>` tag to include the CSS library directly from the CDN in your HTML file's `<head>` section.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/yummacss/dist/yumma.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

#### Minified CSS
For faster loading, you can also include the minified version of the CSS:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/yummacss/public/css/yumma.min.css" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
