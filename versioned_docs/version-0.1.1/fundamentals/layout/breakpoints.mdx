# Breakpoints

Responsive breakpoints allow you to create flexible and adaptable layouts for your web projects. These breakpoints provide fine-grained control over your layout's behavior on different devices.

:::warning Utilizing Breakpoints
To make use of the following classes effectively, you should include a `row{}` class in the main container `<div>`. This ensures proper alignment and spacing of your columns. Here's an example of how to structure your layout:

```html
<div class="gap-1 row">
    <div class="col-12-xsm col-3-lg col-6-md">
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
:::
