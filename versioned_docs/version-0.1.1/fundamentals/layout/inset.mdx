# Inset 

The `ins{}` class provides a quick and convenient way to horizontally and vertically center content within a parent container.

<ClassList
  classData={[
    {
      className: 'ins',
      properties: [
        'align-items: center;',
        'display: flex;',
        'justify-content: center;',
      ]
    },
  ]}
/>

### Centering Content

The `ins{}` class is designed to center content both horizontally and vertically within its parent container. It uses flexbox properties to achieve this, making it easy to create centered elements without the need for complex CSS.

To center content within a parent container, simply add the `ins{}` class to the element you want to center. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="ins">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
