```html
<div class="gap-1 row">
    <div class="col-12-xsm col-3-lg col-6-md">
        <!-- ... -->
    </div>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
:::

- `col-{size}-xsm`: Extra Small Screens
- `col-{size}-sm`: Small Screens
- `col-{size}-md`: Medium Screens
- `col-{size}-lg`: Large Screens
- `col-{size}-xlg`: Extra Large Screens
