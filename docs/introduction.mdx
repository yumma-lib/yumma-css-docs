Are you a visual learner? Here it is our 1-minute [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS05_AV22qA) on YouTube showing everything about Yumma CSS.

### Install via NPM

* Install the CSS library using npm by running the following command in the directory where your project is located:
npm install `yummacss`:

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install yummacss
```

* In your HTML file's `<head>` section, add a `<head>` tag to include the compiled CSS file.

```html title="index.html"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="public/css/yumma.css">
```

### Integrate via CDN

* Add a `<link>` tag to include the CSS library directly from the CDN in your HTML file's `<head>` section.

```html title="index.html"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/yummacss/dist/yumma.css">
```

* If you prefer to utilize an older version, you can effortlessly augment your file's `<head>` section in the CDN by incorporating the specific version number for example:

```html title="index.html"
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/yummacss@v1.0/dist/yumma.css">
```
