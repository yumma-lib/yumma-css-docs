### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:cs-*`, `md:cs-*`, `lg:cs-*`, and `xxl:cs-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:cs-t"
<div class="cs-b md:cs-t ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:cs-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:cs-t"
<div class="cs-b h:cs-t ..."></div>
```
