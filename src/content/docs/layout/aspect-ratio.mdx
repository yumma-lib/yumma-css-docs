### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:ar-*`, `md:ar-*`, `lg:ar-*`, and `xxl:ar-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:ar-l"
<div class="ar-s md:ar-l ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:ar-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:ar-l"
<div class="ar-s h:ar-l ..."></div>
```
