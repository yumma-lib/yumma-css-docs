### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:p-*`, `md:p-*`, `lg:p-*`, and `xxl:p-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:p-s"
<div class="p-a md:p-s ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:p-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:p-s"
<div class="p-a h:p-s ..."></div>
```
