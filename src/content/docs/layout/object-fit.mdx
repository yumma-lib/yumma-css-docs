### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:of-*`, `md:of-*`, `lg:of-*`, and `xxl:of-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:of-sd"
<div class="of-c md:of-sd ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:of-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:of-sd"
<div class="of-c h:of-sd ..."></div>
```
