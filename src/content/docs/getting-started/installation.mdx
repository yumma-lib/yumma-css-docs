## CSS options

Once Yumma CSS has been installed via [Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yummacss) or [CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/yummacss), you will be able to access different compiled CSS files.

- `/dist/yumma.css` — Standard
- `/dist/yumma.min.css` — Minified
- `/dist/yumma-core.css` — Standard (without Stylecent)
- `/dist/yumma-core.min.css` — Minified (without Stylecent)

#### Concepts

Now that you have implemented Yumma CSS, it is important to understand how it differs from other CSS frameworks.
