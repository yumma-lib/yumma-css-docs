### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:a-*`, `md:a-*`, `lg:a-*`, and `xxl:a-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:a-auto"
<div class="a-none md:a-auto ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:a-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:a-auto"
<div class="a-none h:a-auto ..."></div>
```
