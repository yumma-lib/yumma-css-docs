### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:oo-*`, `md:oo-*`, `lg:oo-*`, and `xxl:oo-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:oo-2"
<div class="oo-1 md:oo-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:oo-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:oo-2"
<div class="oo-1 h:oo-2 ..."></div>
```
