### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:b-*`, `md:b-*`, `lg:b-*`, and `xxl:b-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:b-s"
<div class="b-h md:b-s ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:b-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:b-s"
<div class="b-h h:b-s ..."></div>
```
