I'm super happy to announce [Yumma CSS Play](https://play.yummacss.com)! This new and improved version allows you to build your own Yumma CSS components on the web and **preview** them on the fly without any extra setup.

Yumma CSS Play is based on the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which serves as the foundation for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This integration enables developers to prototype and **preview** interface components without the need to install additional packages.
