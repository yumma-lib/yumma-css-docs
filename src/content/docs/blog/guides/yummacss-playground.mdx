I'm super jazzed to announce [Yumma CSS Play](https://play.yummacss.com)! It's a code editor on the web with Yumma CSS built in, so you can create your own Yumma CSS components and see them in action right away.

### What's in the box?

Here it is some features packaged with the extension:

- **Responsiveness**: Test responsiveness by resizing the preview panel.
- **Zero Configuration**: Just write some Yumma CSS, it's already installed!

Yumma CSS Play is powered by [Sandpack](https://codemirror.net/), a code editor component for the web.
