I've been meaning to update the color palette of Yumma CSS for a while, so I'm excited to announce the new version [Yumma CSS v1.2.0](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.2.0)! It has a reworked color palette, new variations for dimension classes, line height classes, and more.

You may also want to take a look at some of the [release notes](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.2.0) but, anyway these are the most noticeable shifts:

- [All new utilities](#all-new-utilities): Heights, Widths, Flex, Box Shadow and Line Height.
- [New color palette](#new-color-palette): New palette with more vivid colors.
- [Extending media queries](#extending-media-queries): Dimension utility class media query extension.
- [Button style](#button-style): Button styling improvements.

This is an incremental update that may contain bug fixes. Minor releases follow [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) conventions. In other words, this should be an easy update for you.

### All new utilities

It's been a while since we've seen new utility classes for `height`, `width`, and `dimension`. Well, here it is — `fit-content`!

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: "h-fc",
      properties: ["height: fit-content;"],
    },
    {
      className: "w-fc",
      properties: ["width: fit-content;"],
    },
    {
      className: "max-h-fc",
      properties: ["max-height: fit-content;"],
    },
    {
      className: "min-h-fc",
      properties: ["max-height: fit-content;"],
    },
    {
      className: "max-w-*",
      properties: ["max-width: fit-content;"],
    },
    {
      className: "min-w-*",
      properties: ["max-width: fit-content;"],
    },
    {
      className: "dim-1",
      properties: ["height: 0.25rem;", "width: 0.25rem;"],
    },
    {
      className: "max-dim-1",
      properties: ["max-height: 0.25rem;", "max-width: 0.25rem;"],
    },
    {
      className: "min-dim-1",
      properties: ["min-height: 0.25rem;", "min-width: 0.25rem;"],
    },
  ]}
/>

I've also expanded the Flex utility classes to include: `auto,` `full`, and `half`.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: "f-auto",
      properties: ["flex: auto;"],
    },
    {
      className: "f-full",
      properties: ["flex: 100%;"],
    },
    {
      className: "f-half",
      properties: ["flex: 50%;"],
    },
  ]}
/>

I've added some new classes for Line Height, which makes it easier to differentiate between text styles.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: "lh-1",
      properties: ["line-height: 1;"],
    },
    {
      className: "lh-2",
      properties: ["line-height: 1.25;"],
    },
    {
      className: "lh-3",
      properties: ["line-height: 1.375;"],
    },
    {
      className: "lh-4",
      properties: ["line-height: 1.5;"],
    },
    {
      className: "lh-5",
      properties: ["line-height: 1.625;"],
    },
    {
      className: "lh-6",
      properties: ["line-height: 2;"],
    },
  ]}
/>

<Preview
  data={`<p class="lh-6 t-l-gray-2">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Justo laoreet sit amet cursus sit amet dictum sit amet. Ultrices eros in cursus turpis. Nec feugiat in fermentum posuere urna nec tincidunt praesent.</p>`}
  useHeight="160px"
  usePadding
  useVersion="1.2.0"
/>

### New color palette

Previously, the colors weren't as rich as I wanted them to be, which was a bit of a limitation because colors with less contrast can go unnoticed in many scenarios. I thought I'd show you the difference between the old and new color palettes in Yumma CSS v1.2.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    <Palette
      data={[
        {
          name: "Blue",
          color: "#3575dd",
        },
        {
          name: "Indigo",
          color: "#595cd9",
        },
      ]}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    <Palette
      data={[
        {
          name: "Blue",
          color: "#438cca",
        },
        {
          name: "Indigo",
          color: "#595cd9",
        },
      ]}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### Transparent support

Oh, another thing, though it's not a color, Yumma CSS v1.2 now supports — `transparent`.

### Extending media queries

Yumma CSS is working on getting around this responsive issue, but for now, let's focus on what we've got. I've added media queries for the `dim-*`, `max-dim-*`, and `min-dim-*` classes.

---

### Button style

I've made a few changes to the button content to make it easier to read.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    <Preview
      data={`<div class="ins h-1/1">
          <button class="btn-pink t-white">Button</button>
        </div>
      `}
      useVersion="1.2.0"
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    <Preview
      data={`<div class="ins h-1/1">
          <button class="btn-pink t-white">Button</button>
        </div>
      `}
      useVersion="1.1.0"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
