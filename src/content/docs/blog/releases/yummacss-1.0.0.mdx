After a few months of development I'm releasing the first major release. For this release, my focus is to implement several utility classes, but more importantly to improve the overall experience of using Yumma CSS. This is — [Yumma CSS v1.0.0](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## What's new in Yumma 1.0.0?

You may also want to take a look at some of the [release notes](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.0.0) but anyway, these are the most noticeable shifts:

- **[Utilities expansion](#utilities-expansion):** Margin X and Y, Padding X and Y, Align Content, and several more.
- **[Viewport expansion](#viewport-expansion):** Support for viewports for Height and Width utilities.
- **[New color](#new-color):** Introducing Lead Color.
- **[Syntax changes](#syntax-changes):** Refactoring display and Hover utility classes.

This is a major update that introduces groundbreaking features. Major releases follow [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) conventions. In other words, you probably need refactoring after upgrading.

### Utilities expansion

This update will mainly focus on flexbox classes, as this was one of the biggest limitations of Yumma CSS before, so I decided to implement a set of utilities to reach even more flexibility of Yumma CSS.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: 'ai-fs',
      properties: [
        'align-items: flex-start;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'ai-fe',
      properties: [
        'align-items: flex-end;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-e',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: end;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-fs',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: flex-start;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-fe',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: flex-end;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-l',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: left;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-r',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: right;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-n',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: normal;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-s',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: stretch;'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

As the layouts of the applications evolve, I feel the need to implement more and more utilities, so here are a few of them:

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: 'd-fr',
      properties: [
        'display: flow-root;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'f-is',
      properties: [
        'float: inline-start;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'f-ie',
      properties: [
        'float: inline-end;'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

A whole new collection of advanced text formatting utilities for typographers is also introduced with Yumma CSS v1.0.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: 'ta-ja',
      properties: [
        'text-align: justify-all;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'ta-mp',
      properties: [
        'text-align: match-parent;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'tdl-o',
      properties: [
        'text-decoration-line: overline;'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

### Viewport expansion

In addition, I'm now adding viewports for the **Height** and **Width** utilities. This will help a lot with responsive designs and I can't wait to expand it to the other utilities.

```html
<div class="... h-10 md:h-auto md:w-auto w-10">...</div>
```

### New color

Nobody builds websites in dark mode using the color gray, right? The new **Lead** color is perfect for creating applications or websites that use dark mode natively.

<Palette
  data={[
    {
      name: 'Lead',
      color: '#3f3f4e'
    }
  ]}
/>

---

### Syntax changes

Changing the syntax for the class name of the **Display** utility, since it wasn't really consistent among the other classes at all.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    ```html
    <div class="d-f"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    ```html
    <div class="dis-f"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

I'm also going to change the syntax for the hover state classes, this change consists of declaring them at the beginning of the utility `h:[value]` to make the code easier to understand.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    ```html
    <div class="h:bg-blue"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    
    ```html
    <div class="bg-h-blue"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
