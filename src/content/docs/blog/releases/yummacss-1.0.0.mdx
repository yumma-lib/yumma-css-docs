After a few months of development, I'm ready to release the first major version. In this release, I'm focusing on implementing a few utility classes and, more importantly, on improving the overall experience of using Yumma CSS.

You may also want to take a look at some of the [release notes](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.0.0) but, anyway, these are the most noticeable shifts:

- [Utilities expansion](#utilities-expansion): Margin X and Y, Padding X and Y, Align Content, and several more.
- [Viewport expansion](#viewport-expansion): Support for viewports for Height and Width utilities.
- [New color](#new-color): Introducing Lead Color.
- [Syntax changes](#syntax-changes): Refactoring display and Hover utility classes.

This is a major update that introduces groundbreaking features. Major releases follow [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) conventions. In other words, you probably need refactoring after upgrading.

### Utilities expansion

This update is mostly about flexbox classes, which were a big limitation of Yumma CSS before. I've added a set of utilities to make Yumma CSS even more flexible.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: "ai-fs",
      properties: ["align-items: flex-start;"],
    },
    {
      className: "ai-fe",
      properties: ["align-items: flex-end;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-e",
      properties: ["justify-content: end;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-fs",
      properties: ["justify-content: flex-start;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-fe",
      properties: ["justify-content: flex-end;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-l",
      properties: ["justify-content: left;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-r",
      properties: ["justify-content: right;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-n",
      properties: ["justify-content: normal;"],
    },
    {
      className: "jc-s",
      properties: ["justify-content: stretch;"],
    },
  ]}
/>

As the layouts of the applications change, I think it'd be good to add more control over the page. I've listed a few of them below:

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: "d-fr",
      properties: ["display: flow-root;"],
    },
    {
      className: "f-is",
      properties: ["float: inline-start;"],
    },
    {
      className: "f-ie",
      properties: ["float: inline-end;"],
    },
  ]}
/>

Yumma CSS v1.0 also introduces a whole new collection of advanced text formatting utilities for typographers.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: "ta-ja",
      properties: ["text-align: justify-all;"],
    },
    {
      className: "ta-mp",
      properties: ["text-align: match-parent;"],
    },
    {
      className: "tdl-o",
      properties: ["text-decoration-line: overline;"],
    },
  ]}
/>

### Viewport expansion

I'm also going to add viewports for the Height and Width utilities. This will be a huge help with responsive designs, and I can't wait to roll it out to the other utilities.

```html
<div class="... h-10 md:h-auto md:w-auto w-10">...</div>
```

---

### New color

I'm sure nobody builds websites in dark mode using gray, right? The new lead color is perfect for creating single-theme apps.

<Palette
  data={[
    {
      name: "Lead",
      color: "#3f3f4e",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Syntax changes

I'm changing the syntax for the Display utility class name because it wasn't really consistent with the other classes.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    ```html
    <div class="d-*"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    ```html
    <div class="dis-*"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

I'm also going to tweak the syntax for the hover state classes. Basically, I'm going to move them to the start of the utility `h:*` to make the code easier to understand.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    ```html
    <div class="h:bg-blue"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    ```html
    <div class="bg-h-blue"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
