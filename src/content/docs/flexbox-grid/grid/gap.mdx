### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:g-*`, `md:g-*`, `lg:g-*`, and `xxl:g-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:g-2"
<div class="g-1 md:g-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:g-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:g-2"
<div class="g-1 h:g-2 ..."></div>
```
