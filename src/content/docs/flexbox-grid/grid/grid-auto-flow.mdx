### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:gaf-*`, `md:gaf-*`, `lg:gaf-*`, and `xxl:gaf-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:gaf-r"
<div class="gaf-c md:gaf-r ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:gaf-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:gaf-r"
<div class="gaf-c h:gaf-r ..."></div>
```
