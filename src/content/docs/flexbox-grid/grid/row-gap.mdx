### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:rg-*`, `md:rg-*`, `lg:rg-*`, and `xxl:rg-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:rg-2"
<div class="rg-1 md:rg-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:rg-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:rg-2"
<div class="rg-1 h:rg-2 ..."></div>
```
