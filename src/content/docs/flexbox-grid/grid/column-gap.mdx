### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:cg-*`, `md:cg-*`, `lg:cg-*`, and `xxl:cg-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:cg-2"
<div class="cg-1 md:cg-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:cg-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:cg-2"
<div class="cg-1 h:cg-2 ..."></div>
```
