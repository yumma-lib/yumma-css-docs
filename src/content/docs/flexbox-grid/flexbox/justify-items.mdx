### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:ji-*`, `md:ji-*`, `lg:ji-*`, and `xxl:ji-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:ji-s"
<div class="ji-e md:ji-s ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:ji-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:ji-s"
<div class="ji-e h:ji-s ..."></div>
```
