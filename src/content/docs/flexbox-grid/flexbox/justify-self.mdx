### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:js-*`, `md:js-*`, `lg:js-*`, and `xxl:js-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:js-r"
<div class="js-l md:js-r ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:js-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:js-r"
<div class="js-l h:js-r ..."></div>
```
