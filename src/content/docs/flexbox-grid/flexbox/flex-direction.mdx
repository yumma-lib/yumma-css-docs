### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:fd-*`, `md:fd-*`, `lg:fd-*`, and `xxl:fd-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:fd-r"
<div class="fd-c md:fd-r ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:fd-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:fd-r"
<div class="fd-c h:fd-r ..."></div>
```
