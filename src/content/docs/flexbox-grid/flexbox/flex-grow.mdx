### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:fg-*`, `md:fg-*`, `lg:fg-*`, and `xxl:fg-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:fg-2"
<div class="fg-1 md:fg-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:fg-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:fg-2"
<div class="fg-1 h:fg-2 ..."></div>
```
