### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:fs-*`, `md:fs-*`, `lg:fs-*`, and `xxl:fs-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:fs-2"
<div class="fs-1 md:fs-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:fs-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:fs-2"
<div class="fs-1 h:fs-2 ..."></div>
```
