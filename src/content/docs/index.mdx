<Card title="But, why?">
  Yumma CSS uses an abbreviated naming convention that's similar to the regular
  CSS syntax.

  <Code code={yummaCard} lang="html" title="index.html" frame="terminal" wrap="false" mark={["ovf-h", "b-1", "bs-xs", "fg-1", "fs-xxl", "fw-600", "tc-pink", "tdl-u", "rad-2", "bg-pink", "tc-white"]} />
