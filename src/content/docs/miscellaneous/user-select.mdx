### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:us-*`, `md:us-*`, `lg:us-*`, and `xxl:us-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:us-auto"
<div class="us-none md:us-auto ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:us-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:us-auto"
<div class="us-none h:us-auto ..."></div>
```
