Utilities to disable the styling of the original form controls.

<Utility
  data={[
    {
      className: 'a-none',
      properties: [
        'appearance: none;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'a-auto',
      properties: [
        'appearance: auto;'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

### Using breakpoints

The utilization of breakpoint modifiers, like `sm:a-*`, `md:a-*`, `lg:a-*` enables the targeting of specific utilities in disparate viewports.
