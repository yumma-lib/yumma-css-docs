### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:pe-*`, `md:pe-*`, `lg:pe-*`, and `xxl:pe-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:pe-auto"
<div class="pe-none md:pe-auto ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:pe-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:pe-auto"
<div class="pe-none h:pe-auto ..."></div>
```
