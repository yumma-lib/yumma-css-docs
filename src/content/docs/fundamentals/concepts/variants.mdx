## Hovers

You can use the `h:` variants in order to target the `:hover` function across the entirety of the Yumma CSS utility classes.

For instance, if you want to apply the `bg-pink` class on hover, you can use the `h:bg-pink class`.

<Hover>
  Move the mouse over the button to see how the background color changes.
</Hover>

<Preview
  data={`<button class="bg-pink fw-600 h:bg-d-pink-2 px-5 py-1 rad-8 tc-white c-p">Subscribe</button>`}
  noScroll
  useCenter
  useHighlights={["h:bg-d-pink-2"]}
  usePadding
  useVersion="2.0.0"
/>

In this example, we have a button component using the `:hover` utility class, which in this context is being used to change the `bg-pink` to `bg-d-pink-2` when the user hovers the mouse over the element.
