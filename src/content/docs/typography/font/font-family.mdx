### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:ff-*`, `md:ff-*`, `lg:ff-*`, and `xxl:ff-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:ff-i"
<div class="ff-d md:ff-i ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:ff-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:ff-i"
<div class="ff-d h:ff-i ..."></div>
```
