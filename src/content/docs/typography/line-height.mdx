The world, pure white, offered only fleeting motion. In the midst of longing, Ren found a quiet surrender, waiting in timeless silence. Each soul's trajectory told a unique story of its journey.</p>`}

### Using breakpoints

The utilization of breakpoint modifiers, like `sm:lh-*`, `md:lh-*`, `lg:lh-*`, and `xxl:lh-*` enables the targeting of specific utilities in disparate viewports.

```html "md:lh-4"
<p class="lh-3 md:lh-4 ...">
  In an endless white expanse, Ren stood by a solitary tree...
</p>
```

### Using variants

The `:hover` variant, such as `h:lh-*`, allows you to modify elements and override other line height styles when hovering over them.

```html "h:lh-4"
<p class="lh-3 h:lh-4 ...">
  In an endless white expanse, Ren stood by a solitary tree...
</p>
```
