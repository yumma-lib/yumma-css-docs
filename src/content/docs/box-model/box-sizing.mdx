### Using breakpoints

Using responsive breakpoints like `sm:bs-*`, `md:bs-*`, `lg:bs-*`, and `xxl:bs-*` allows targeting specific utilities in different viewports.

```html "md:bs-2"
<div class="bs-1 md:bs-2 ..."></div>
```

### Using variants

Using `:hover` variants such as `h:bs-*` allows you to override elements and change their values when hovering over them.

```html "h:bs-2"
<div class="bs-1 h:bs-2 ..."></div>
```
