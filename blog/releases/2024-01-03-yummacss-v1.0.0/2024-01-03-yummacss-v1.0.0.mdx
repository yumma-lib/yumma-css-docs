import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

After a few months of development I'm releasing the first major release. For this release, my focus is to implement several utility classes, but more importantly to improve the overall experience of using Yumma CSS. This is â€” [Yumma CSS v1.0](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## What's new?

Those were the most noticeable shifts:

- [x] **[Utilities expansion](#utilities-expansion):** Margin X and Y, Padding X and Y, Align Content, and several more.

- [x] **[Viewport expansion](#viewport-expansion):** Support for viewports for Height and Width utilities.

- [x] **[New color](#new-color):** Introducing Lead Color.

- [x] **[Syntax changes](#syntax-changes):** Refactoring display and Hover utility classes.

Again, if you want a much deeper breakdown, you can look at the [release notes](https://github.com/yumma-lib/yumma-css/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

### Utilities expansion

This update will mainly focus on flexbox classes, as this was one of the biggest limitations of Yumma CSS before, so I decided to implement a set of utilities to reach even more flexibility of Yumma CSS.

<ClassList
  classData={[
    {
      className: 'ai-fs',
      properties: [
        'align-items: flex-start;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'ai-fe',
      properties: [
        'align-items: flex-end;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-e',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: end;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-fs',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: flex-start;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-fe',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: flex-end;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-l',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: left;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-r',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: right;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-n',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: normal;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'jc-s',
      properties: [
        'justify-content: stretch;'
      ]
    },
  ]}
/>

As the layouts of the applications evolve, I feel the need to implement more and more utilities, so here are a few of them:

<ClassList
  classData={[
    {
      className: 'd-fr',
      properties: [
        'display: flow-root;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'f-is',
      properties: [
        'float: inline-start;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'f-ie',
      properties: [
        'float: inline-end;'
      ]
    },
  ]}
/>

A whole new collection of advanced text formatting utilities for typographers is also introduced with Yumma CSS v1.0.

<ClassList
  classData={[
    {
      className: 'ta-ja',
      properties: [
        'text-align: justify-all;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'ta-mp',
      properties: [
        'text-align: match-parent;'
      ]
    },
    {
      className: 'tdl-o',
      properties: [
        'text-decoration-line: overline;'
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

### Viewport expansion

In addition, I'm now adding viewports for the **Height** and **Width** utilities. This will help a lot with responsive designs and I can't wait to expand it to the other utilities.

```html
<div class="... h-10 md:h-auto md:w-auto w-10">...</div>
```

---

### New color

Nobody builds websites in dark mode using the color gray, right? The new **Lead** color is perfect for creating applications or websites that use dark mode natively.

<ColorPalette
  colorData={[
    {
      name: 'Lead',
      color: '#3f3f4e'
    }
  ]}
/>

---

### Syntax changes

Changing the syntax for the class name of the **Display** utility, since it wasn't really consistent among the other classes at all.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    ```html
    <div class="d-f"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    ```html
    <div class="dis-f"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

I'm also going to change the syntax for the hover state classes, this change consists of declaring them at the beginning of the utility `h:[value]` to make the code easier to understand.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="now" label="Now">
    ```html
    <div class="h:bg-blue"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="then" label="Then">
    
    ```html
    <div class="bg-h-blue"></div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
